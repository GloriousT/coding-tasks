Word Counter
You are supposed to implement a word counter.
-	It should expose a method with String parameter named “word”. This method is expected to be invoked multiple times with different words
-	It should also expose another method with String parameter named “word”, which should return integer value telling how many times the passed word was accepted by the previous method.
-   The word counter should be case-insensitive.

It should accept the words in any language and translate them. No REAL translation is needed, we should assume we're using
existing translator interface.
