You’re supposed to write the method that plays ping-pong. It should accept String parameter.
If the argument passed will be “ping” it should return String “pong”. Otherwise it will return String “ping to you”.
If you call the method 10 times in a row with "ping" - it should return you “You won! Congrats!”.
