/**
 *Word Counter
 * You are supposed to implement a word counter.
 * -	It should expose a method with String parameter named “word”. This method is expected to be invoked multiple
 *      times with different words
 * -	It should also expose another method with String parameter named “word”, which should return integer value
 *      telling how many times the passed word was accepted by the previous method.
 * -	The word counter should be case-insensitive.
