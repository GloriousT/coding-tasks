Phone Book
You are supposed to write a phone book.
It should accept many invocations of a method with two String parameters called "name" and "phoneNumber". This method adds one phone number for a person at a time, however more than one phone number can be assigned to the same person.
It should expose another method with String parameter called "name", which should return all phones recorded for this person.
The phone book should be case-insensitive.
